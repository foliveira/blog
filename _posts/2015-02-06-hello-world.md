And so it all begins. This kind of idea has been brewing in my mind for a long time and now it has flown out of the window.

## I'm starting a blog.

Before I say anything about it, let me just clarify that I don't have that many ideas flying around, so I won't adhere to a specific schedule; also all of the subsequent posts will be the ramblings of someone who has an opinion and as such should be treated as that individual's opinion and as nothing else.

Having said all of that, I can only promise that sometimes I'll bore you with stuff that doesn't appeal to you. Such is life. Also I promise I'll break the English language more than I would wish for. _C'est la vie_.

I can only hope you kept on reading for so long as to come this far and will still be here for the next post.

Thank you!
